# FLP a.k.a. Fake landing page

The sole purpose of this project was/is to learn, primarily Svelte and SvelteKit, and to become proficient in them so that I can use them for future projects. I love their syntax and features. In addition to Svelte and SvelteKit, I am also working on improving my graphic and vector skills, creating SVG animations."

While working on this project I realized i've never done something like dynamic dashboard, datepicker from scratch. I made some simple datepicker for now, it has lot of flaws and not enough features,
but I learned how to properly trap focus, do some a11y stuff on datepickers. Dashboard is now in WIP state, it's simple, is not dynamic, but first I want to create few widgets, to fill it with stuff, so it doesn't look empty and has few features.
After adding more widgets, stuff, I will shift my focus on implementing dynamic aspects of dashboard, that may or may not include (we'll see) resizable, removable widgets with separate configurations and settings (refresh rate, own set of actions), for now I can't think of all of the things I want to implement, so that's it for now.
